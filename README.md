# Distributed Systems Project - Winter Semester 2018
In a sequence of project assignments, a multi-server file system called Yet-Another File System (yfs) was implemented in the spirit of Frangipani. The eight project stages corresponded to the design and implementation of:
1. Lock Server
2. Basic File Server
3. Reading, Writing and Sharing Files
4. MKDIR, REMOVE and Locking
5. Caching Lock Server
6. Caching Extent Server and Consistency
7. Paxos
8. Replicated Lock Server

The software produced was graded based on its ability to successfully pass a set of functional and performance tests.
